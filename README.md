Features:

Data Collection: Preprocessed sample Twitter dataset.

Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions and word clouds.

Feature Engineering: Vectorization using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.

Model Building: Classification models built using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
